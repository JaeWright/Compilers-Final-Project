# Compilers-Final-Project

This repository contains an ANTLR Grammar, backend files with a parser (.kt), and a worksheet for testing the implementations.

While already containing the rules for String arithmetics, Mixed arithmetics, Loops, Functions, and Recursion, I also implemented support for:
- While Loops
- Arrays (Assignment, Reassignment, Indexing)
